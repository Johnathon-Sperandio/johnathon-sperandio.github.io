I am creating a user website to be deployed on Github Pages. Help me write my file skeletons please.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like it so that the header line wraps up around the "Home" when at the home page, around the "About" when on that page, and so on so that the user has some extra understanding about where they are on my website.
